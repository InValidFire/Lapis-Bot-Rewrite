# Lapis Bot Rewrite
* By InValidFire

## Purpose
You won't really have a use for this unless you're on my Discord server, as its prime function is to aid us over there.

### Current features
* Scheduled Event Announcements (WIP)
  * Send announcements at a specific time (Done)
  * Allow for custom event messages (Done)
  * Command for adding/removing events from Discord (WIP)
  * Command to reload the events.cfg file without a reboot (WIP)
* Convert Overworld coordinates to Nether coordinates
* Convert various temperature units
* Add numbers

### Planned features
* Server activity tracking
* Allow players to set their own time zone, and others to query it.
