# Lapis Bot Rewrite
* By InValidFire

## Purpose
You won't really have a use for this unless you're on my Discord server, as its prime function is to aid us over there.

### Current features
* Scheduled Event Announcements (WIP)
  * Send announcements at a specific time (Done)
  * Allow for custom event messages (Done)
  * Command for adding/removing events from Discord (WIP)
  * Command to reload the events.cfg file without a reboot (WIP)

### Planned features
* Allow players to set their own time zone, and others to query it.

### Contributing
If you're feeling kind and you see a bug or issue that you can fix, feel free to make modifications and submit a pull request!
